Hello~

My name is Yuni Susanti, and I am currently a <del>first</del> <del>second</del> third year PhD student at the <a href="http://www.cl.cs.titech.ac.jp/en/start">Computational Linguistics/ Natural Language Processing group (自然言語処理研究室)</a>, Computer Science Department, <a href="http://www.titech.ac.jp/">Tokyo Institute of Technology,</a> Japan, under the supervision of Prof. Takenobu Tokunaga.

<img class="wp-image-2039 alignright" src="https://littleflow3r.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/img_6079.png" alt="IMG_6079" width="219" height="292" />My interest in the field of CL/ NLP can be traced back to about 5 years ago, when I started working on my undergraduate thesis, which was about Automatic Text Summarisation. I got my bachelor degree from <a href="http://if.mipa.uns.ac.id/">Informatics Department,</a> <a href="https://uns.ac.id/id/">University of Sebelas Maret,</a> Indonesia. That was when I found a book titled <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53336.Women_Fire_and_Dangerous_Things">"Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things: What Categories Reveal About Minds"</a>, which, contrary to its unusual title, is a book about cognitive linguistic written by George Lakoff. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women,_Fire,_and_Dangerous_Things">Wikipedia</a>, the book's title was inspired by the noun class system of the <em>Dyirbal</em> language, in which the "feminine" category includes nouns for women, water, fire, violence, and certain animals. I have been always a bit feminist myself, so I liked that title.

I wanted to pursue a higher degree; and if possible, abroad, so I applied to International Graduate Program in Titech, and successfully secured Monbukagakusho (MEXT) Scholarship. I started my PhD right after I got my master degree from Titech in autumn 2015, with a master's thesis focusing on automatic generation of English vocabulary questions. My current research still focuses on automatic question generation for English learning, extending on controlling the difficulty of the machine-generated questions.

Prior to undertaking master’s study, I spent almost 2 years working on a startup web development company <a href="http://www.duxeos.com">Duxeos</a>, with some friends from my undergraduate study.

Let's get a bit personal and talk about hobbies. I <em>normally</em> spend 50% of my whole day for <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4231042-yuni-susanti" target="_blank" rel="noopener">book</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/user/ur76948352/?ref_=nb_usr_prof_0">movies</a>, 20% for drawing, 10% for writing (you might find lots of <del>creepy</del> love poems or short-stories in this <a href="https://littleflow3r.wordpress.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog</a>), and the rest for others (yes, yes, doing research is one of them. yes yes, thinking about future husband is one of them :p ). When I was in Indonesia I spent 50% of my day playing with my cats but now we are on long-distance relationship :') And oh, I do like cooking recently.

Lastly, here is a memento from me you can bring back home. A beautiful quote from Desiderius Erasmus, a renaissance humanist:
<blockquote>Ignis mare mulier, tria mala / Fire, sea, and woman, here be evils three</blockquote>
Told you. I have always been a bit feminist myself. :) bye, xoxo
